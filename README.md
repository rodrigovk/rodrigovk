With over 13 years of experience working as a developer, I am a self-taught professional with deep knowledge in the field, known for being organized, proactive, committed, and highly adaptable. I started my career using Delphi (Object Pascal) and I'm currently working with JavaScript and TypeScript! During these years I've handled and learnt lots of technologies: relational databases, multiple frameworks, numerous API integrations and the list goes on.

I co-founded a company many years ago and developed by myself all the ERP solutions our enterprise clients use until now. Had a role over all the areas, even the product planning, testing, user experience and customer management.

During the last months I did my first ever interview and was invited to join [Friday Finance](https://fridayfinance.com/), where I found the missing inspiration to move forward with my career!
